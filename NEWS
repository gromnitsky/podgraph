0.0.4

Tue Apr 19 19:01:14 EEST 2011

- Fixed one RE to support https:// images.

- Dropped activesupport dependency.

- Injected falsework's naive template.

0.0.3

- added missing activesupport dependency (btw, activesupport 3.0.0
  requires i18n (run 'gem install i18n', for some reason this dependency
  isn't listed in the gem).

0.0.2

- nailed the mail gem to explicit version 2.1.3, because the current
  2.2.0 introduced some weird bugs.
